Price Calculator: A real-time estimation tool that provides transparent cost breakdowns for print jobs, including active discounts and promotions.

I have implemented the Page Per Set logic and updated the pricing calculation to accurately reflect the cost savings when printing multiple pages on a single sheet.

Key Changes:
NormalPrint.jsx
Implemented Local Calculation Logic: Added a specialized 
calculateLocal
 function within 
calculatePrice
 that:
Calculates the number of effective sides by dividing total document pages by the selected pagesPerSet (using Math.ceil).
Applies the appropriate base rate ($₹2$ for B&W, $₹10$ for Color).
Includes a 20% discount for double-sided printing to reflect standard printing costs.
Multiplies the result by the number of copies.
Robust Error Handling: Updated the API fallback and error catch blocks to use this new logic, ensuring the price is always calculated correctly even if the backend is unavailable.
Support for New PPS Options: The calculation automatically supports the new 9 and 16 pages per set options you added to the configuration.
