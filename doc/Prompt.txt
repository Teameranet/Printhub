Let me create this missing file and also check for any other potential issues to fix all bugs.

1. After a user signs up or logs  display user name right side of the icon (example "Ashwin") and I want a "Logout" option or further customization

2. If I move the mouse coursor on "User Name"  give the hover effect options dropdown "Profile " and "Log out " with icon

3. Create a User Profile Page


4. If user click on "Profile" view user profile details & If user click on "Logout" go to home   page and show tost notification "Logout sussufully"
   [apply effect on mouse coursor on The Profile and Logout options dropdown  hover over effect menu]

5.  Update the "Track Your Order Number" input field white baground layout is 448px wide and 241.6px tall. Dont change the layout size "Tracking order detail"

6. Move search icon in input filed box 

7. Update the layout "Tracking order detail"only as 896px in width and  663.84px in height.
   Do not  change "Track Your Order Number" input field's white background layout keep exactly 448px wide and 241.6px.
 
   After User Sign Up/In show "2" on and view cart page
